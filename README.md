This project is a comprehensive Lab Appointment System designed to revolutionize the way appointments and lab tests are managed at ABC Laboratories. Developed with the modern and robust Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, this system offers a seamless and interactive user experience for both patients and administrators. The Spring Boot framework enhances the backend with its fast development, security features, and easy database integration, ensuring reliable and efficient handling of data. React, known for its high performance and flexibility, makes the frontend responsive and intuitive, facilitating easy navigation through the system's features.

The system allows for patient registration, appointment scheduling, and provides patients with unique IDs for easy tracking of their appointments and test results. A secure payment gateway is integrated for hassle-free transactions. Additionally, it features a sophisticated report generation tool for operational and managerial decision-making. With differential access rights, the system ensures data security and privacy.

This repository contains the complete source code, including a well-documented API, and is structured for easy understanding and further development. Continuous integration and deployment practices are followed, leveraging Git for version control and efficient collaboration among developers.
